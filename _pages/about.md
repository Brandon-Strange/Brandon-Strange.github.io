I am a PhD candidate at the University of Arizona. My work entails the investigation of how forests in the western US are responding to climate change from an ecophysiological approach using stable isotopes in tree rings. In addition to examining forest response to climate change, I also work to better understand how plant ecophysiology has changed on paleo timescales using both ecophysiological and dendrochronological techniques.
